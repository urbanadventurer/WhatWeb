1. About WhatWeb
================================================================================

WhatWeb identifies websites. It's goal is to answer the question, "What is that Website?". WhatWeb recognises web technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded devices. WhatWeb has over 900 plugins, each to recognise something different. WhatWeb also identifies version numbers, email addresses, account ID's, web framework modules, SQL errors, and more.

WhatWeb can be stealthy and fast, or thorough but slow. WhatWeb supports an aggression level to control the trade off between speed and reliability. When you visit a website in your browser, the transaction includes many hints of what web technologies are powering that website. Sometimes a single webpage visit contains enough information to identify a website but when it does not, WhatWeb can interrogate the website further. The default level of aggression, called 'passive', is the fastest and requires only one HTTP request of a website. This is suitable for scanning public websites. More aggressive modes were developed for in penetration tests.

Most WhatWeb plugins are thorough and recognise a range of cues from subtle to obvious. For example, most WordPress websites can be identified by the meta HTML tag, e.g. '<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 2.6.5">', but a minority of WordPress websites remove this identifying tag but this does not thwart WhatWeb. The WordPress WhatWeb plugin has over 15 tests, which include checking the favicon, default installation files, login pages, and checking for "/wp-content/" within relative links.


Features:
	* Over 900 plugins
	* Control the trade off between speed/stealth and reliability
	* Plugins include example URLs
	* Performance tuning. Control how many websites to scan concurrently.
	* Multiple log formats: Brief (greppable), Verbose (human readable), XML, JSON, MagicTree, RubyObject, MongoDB.
	* Recursive web spidering
	* Proxy support including TOR
	* Custom HTTP headers
	* Basic HTTP authentication
	* Control over webpage redirection
	* Nmap-style IP ranges
	* Fuzzy matching
	* Result certainty awareness
	* Custom plugins defined on the command line

All plugins are loaded by default.

Plugins can be selected by directories, files or plugin names as a comma delimited list with the -p or --plugin command line option.

Each list item may have a modifier: + adds to the full set, - removes from the full set and no modifier overrides the defaults.

Examples :

	--plugins +plugins-disabled,-foobar
	--plugins +/tmp/moo.rb
	--plugins foobar (only select foobar)
	-p title,md5,+./plugins-disabled/
	-p ./plugins-disabled,-md5


6. Aggression
================================================================================

WhatWeb features several levels of aggression. By default the aggression level is set to 1 (passive) which sends a single HTTP GET request.

--aggression, -a

	1 (Passive)	Make one HTTP request per target. Except for redirects.
	2 (Polite)	Reserved for future use
	3 (Aggressive)	Triggers aggressive plugin functions only when a
			plugin matches passively.
	4 (Heavy)	Trigger aggressive functions for all plugins. Guess a
			lot of URLs like Nikto.

If aggression is enabled the aggressive plugins will guess more URLs and perform actions that are potentially unsuitable without permission.

With the passive matches we know that smartor.is-root.com/forum/ is running phpBB version 2:

$ ./whatweb smartor.is-root.com/forum/
http://smartor.is-root.com/forum/ [200] PasswordField[password], HTTPServer[Apache/2.2.15], PoweredBy[phpBB], Apache[2.2.15], IP[88.198.177.36], phpBB[2], PHP[5.2.13], test[Smartors Mods Forums - Reloaded], X-Powered-By[PHP/5.2.13], Cookies[phpbb2mysql_data,phpbb2mysql_sid], Title[Smartors Mods Forums - Reloaded], Country[GERMANY][DE]


With the aggressive matches in the phpBB plugin we know that the same website is running phpBB version 2.0.20 or higher:

$ ./whatweb -p plugins/phpbb.rb -a 3 smartor.is-root.com/forum/
http://smartor.is-root.com/forum/ [200] phpBB[2,>2.0.20]

Note the use of the -p argument to select only the phpBB plugin. It is advisable, but not mandatory, to select a specific plugin when attempting to fingerprint software versions in aggressive mode. This approach is far more stealthy as it will limit the number of requests.

Do not use aggressive plugins with recursive site crawling. WhatWeb has no understanding of a website, instead it currently treats each URL separately. 

It also has no caching so if you use aggressive plugins with recursion you will fetch the same files multiple times. The same is true for aggressive modes on redirecting URLs.



7. Recursive Spidering
================================================================================

The recursion option is used to scan some or all of a website with WhatWeb. Recursive spidering will follow each link on a webpage if it is within the same website, then repeat the process on the followed pages.

The configurable settings for recursive spidering are:
	--recursion, -r		Follow links recursively. Only follows links under the path (default: off)
	--depth, -d		Maximum recursion depth (default: 10)
	--max-links, -m		Maximum number of links to follow on one page (default: 250)
	--spider-skip-extensions Redefine extensions to skip. (Default: zip,gz,tar,jpg,exe,png,pdf)

Limitations of the spidering. This follows links in <a> tags, these are the HTML tags designed specifically for links. The spider does not obtain URLs from other sources. Some good choices for future improvement are image tags, e.g. <img src="/images/boats.jpg">, form tags, e.g. <form action="/vote.php">, URL paths in CSS files, etc.

The spider is provided by Anemone, a third party ruby gem. It doesn't follow redirects. For example the URL treshna.com will fail and www.treshna.com will produce results.



8. Performance & Stability
================================================================================

WhatWeb features several options to increase performance and stability.

  --max-threads, -t     Number of simultaneous threads. Default: 25.
  --open-timeout        Time in seconds. Default: 15
  --read-timeout        Time in seconds. Default: 30
  --wait=SECONDS        Wait SECONDS between connections
                        This is useful when using a single thread.

The --wait and --max-threads commands can be used to assist in IDS evasion.

Furthermore, changing the user-agent using the -U or --user-agent command line option will avoid the Snort IDS rule for WhatWeb.

Without the em-resolve-replace gem performance is significantly degraded.

If you are scanning ranges of IP addresses, it is much more efficient to use a port scanner like nmap to discover which have port 80 open before scanning with WhatWeb.

Character set detection, with the Charset plugin, required by JSON and MongoDB logging uses more CPU than otherwise.



9. Optional Dependencies
================================================================================

Without the em-resolve-replace gem performance is significantly degraded.
	gem install em-resolve-replace

To enable JSON logging install the json gem.
	gem install json

To enable MongoDB logging install the mongo gem.
	gem install mongo

To enable character set detection and MongoDB logging install the rchardet gem.
	gem install rchardet
